# Cluster-Analysis

Cluster analysis plays an important role in the exploratory data analysis turn. Under the unsupervised learning paradigm, clustering is one of the main cores that runs data segmentation and patterns detection.

In the notebook, we address questions like:

  1. How to perform cluster analysis using the K-Means technique?
  2. How to find the optimal number of clusters?
  3. How to identify appropriate features?
  4. Why and when do we need standardize the data?
  5. Which are the pros and cons of using K-Means?
  6. How to interpret the results?
